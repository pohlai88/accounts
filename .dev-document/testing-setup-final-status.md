## 🚨 **CURRENT ISSUES AND SOLUTIONS**

### **Issue 1: Stryker Configuration Warnings**

**Problem**: Stryker is showing warnings about deprecated options
**Solution**: Use modern Stryker configuration

### **Issue 2: Mutation Test Hanging**

**Problem**: Full mutation tests take 90+ minutes
**Solution**: Focused testing approach

### **Issue 3: Invariant Test NaN Values**

**Problem**: One invariant test fails with NaN values
**Solution**: Add filters to arbitrary generators

---

## 🚀 **ALTERNATIVE SOLUTIONS**

### **Solution 1: Manual Test Quality Verification**

Instead of relying on mutation testing, we can manually verify test quality:

```bash
# 1. Run unit tests to verify they work
pnpm test:unit --filter=@aibos/accounting

# 2. Check error code coverage
node scripts/check-error-codes.js

# 3. Run invariant tests
pnpm test:invariants

# 4. Verify test files exist
ls tests/unit/accounting/
```

### **Solution 2: Test Quality Metrics**

We can measure test quality using existing tools:

```bash
# Test coverage
pnpm test:coverage

# Test performance
time pnpm test:unit --filter=@aibos/accounting

# Test reliability (run multiple times)
for i in {1..5}; do pnpm test:unit --filter=@aibos/accounting; done
```

### **Solution 3: Focused Mutation Testing**

Create a minimal mutation test for a single function:

```bash
# Test only arithmetic operations
npx stryker run -c stryker.quick.conf.cjs --timeoutMS 30000
```

## 🎯 **RECOMMENDED NEXT STEPS**

### **Immediate Actions (Today)**

1. **Fix Invariant Test** (5 minutes)

   ```typescript
   // Add NaN filters to arbitrary generators
   fc.double({ min: 0.01, max: 1000 }).filter(val => !isNaN(val) && isFinite(val));
   ```

2. **Verify Test Quality** (10 minutes)

   ```bash
   # Run focused unit tests
   pnpm test:unit --filter=@aibos/accounting

   # Check error coverage
   node scripts/check-error-codes.js
   ```

3. **Test Performance** (5 minutes)
   ```bash
   # Measure test execution time
   time pnpm test:unit --filter=@aibos/accounting
   ```
