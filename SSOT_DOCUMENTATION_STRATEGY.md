# SSOT Documentation Strategy

## Overview

This document outlines the Single Source of Truth (SSOT) documentation strategy for the AI-BOS Accounting SaaS platform, ensuring consistent, accurate, and maintainable documentation across all packages and applications.

## Documentation Principles

### 1. Single Source of Truth
- Each piece of information has one authoritative source
- Documentation is synchronized with actual codebase
- No duplicate or conflicting information
- Version-controlled documentation

### 2. Code-First Documentation
- Documentation is generated from code when possible
- API documentation is auto-generated from TypeScript types
- Examples are tested and validated
- Documentation reflects actual implementation

### 3. Developer-Centric
- Documentation serves the next developer
- Clear examples and usage patterns
- Troubleshooting guides and common issues
- Performance considerations and best practices

## Documentation Structure

### Main Documentation
```
â”œâ”€â”€ README.md                           # Main project overview
â”œâ”€â”€ SSOT_DOCUMENTATION_STRATEGY.md      # This document
â”œâ”€â”€ OPTIMIZATION_OPPORTUNITIES.md       # Performance and improvement opportunities

    â”œâ”€â”€ web-api/README.md               # API application documentation
    â””â”€â”€ web/README.md                   # Web application documentation
```

## Documentation Standards

### 1. README Structure
Each README should follow this structure:

```markdown
# Package Name

Brief description of the package purpose.

## Installation
```bash
pnpm add @aibos/package-name
```

## Quick Start
Basic usage example with code.

## API Reference
Detailed API documentation with examples.

## Configuration
Environment variables and configuration options.

## Testing
How to run tests and testing strategies.

## Dependencies
Key dependencies and their purposes.

## Performance Considerations
Performance notes and optimization tips.

## Security
Security considerations and best practices.
```

### 2. Code Examples
- All examples must be tested and working
- Examples should be minimal but complete
- Include error handling in examples
- Show both basic and advanced usage

### 3. Type Documentation
- Use TypeScript for all type definitions
- Export types from package index files
- Document complex types with JSDoc comments
- Provide type examples in documentation

  - API changes are made
  - Dependencies are updated
  - Configuration changes occur
  - Security updates are implemented

## Documentation Tools

### 1. TypeDoc
- Generate API documentation from TypeScript
- Maintain type documentation automatically
- Export documentation as markdown

### 2. JSDoc
